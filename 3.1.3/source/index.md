# Gluu Gateway 3.1.3

## Overview

Gluu Gateway is an API Gateway which can be used to quickly deploy an OAuth 2.0 and User-Managed Access (UMA) 2.0 Grant protected API gateway.

1. In the OAUTH Mode, an OAuth token is generated with the use of Consumer credentials (oxd_id, client_id and client_secret). Then a call with the access token is made to Kong which proxies the Upstream API. You can read more about Consumer credentials in the [Consumer section](./admin-gui.md#consumers).

1. In the UMA Mode, an RPT token is generated by sending UMA Plugin credentials to Gluu Gateway. After checking the access and obtaining a ticket, you can generate an access token which is used to make an API request. You can read more about UMA in [Gluu OAuth 2.0 UMA RS plugin](./plugin/api.md#gluu-oauth-20-uma-rs-plugin).

1. In the Mix Mode, an OAuth token is generated with the use of Consumer credentials (oxd_id, client_id and client_secret). Optionally, the client can also send pushed claims with the UMA_PUSHED_CLAIMS header. You can make an API call using an access token. Gluu Gateway will proxy the Upstream API, automatically executing the UMA flow without any user input.

## Components

Gluu Gateway uses the following components:

1. **[Gluu Server v3.1.3](https://gluu.org):** A free open source software package for identity and access management. You should need to use Gluu Server version >= 3.1.3.
1. **[OXD-Server v3.1.3](https://oxd.gluu.org):** An OpenID Connect and UMA middleware service used for client credential management and cryptographic validation. 
1. **[Kong v0.11.x](https://getkong.org):** An open source API Gateway and Micro services Management Layer, delivering high performance and reliability.
1. **[Gluu Kong plugins](https://github.com/GluuFederation/gluu-gateway)**: Use Gluu Server to control access to upstream APIs using OAuth 2.0 clients and UMA 2.0.
1. **[Admin GUI - Konga](https://github.com/GluuFederation/gluu-gateway/tree/master/konga)**: A web administration portal, based on [Konga](https://github.com/pantsel/konga) GUI, which makes it easier to manage your Gluu Gateway.
1. **Others**: The following runtime environment required by the Gluu Gateway package: 
    - OpenJDK v8
    - Python v2.x
    - Postgres v10
    - Node v8.9.4
    - NPM v5.6.0
