# Clustering

Gluu-Gateway is based on the [Kong Gateway](https://konghq.com/kong/). The worldâ€™s most popular open source API gateway.

Kong supports clustering, please check the docs for more details about clustering [here](https://docs.konghq.com/1.3.x/clustering/).

A Kong cluster allows you to scale the system horizontally by adding more machines/VMs/containers to handle more incoming requests.

**To configure multiple Kong nodes into a cluster, point them all to the same datastore or use the same declarative config in DB-less mode.**

**You need a load-balancer in front of your Kong cluster to distribute traffic across your available nodes.**

## Setup Gluu-Gateway node by OS package

### 1. Install Kong

Install Kong from the [Kong official website.](https://konghq.com/install/)

### 2. Setup GG plugins and libs

- Download [gluu-gateway-node-deps.zip](https://github.com/GluuFederation/gluu-gateway/raw/version_4.0/gluu-gateway-node-deps.zip)

- `unzip gluu-gateway-node-deps.zip`

- `cd gluu-gateway-node-deps`

- `python gg-kong-node-setup.py`

- Script will ask you following question about your postgres db. This is the database which your are sharing between the multiple nodes.

    | Questions | Descriptions |
    |-----------|--------------|
    |Enter PG host|Enter your postgres database host or ip|
    |Enter PG Port|Enter your postgres database port|
    |Enter PG User|Enter your postgres database user|
    |Enter PG Password|Enter your postgres database password. It will not show during typing values, so you just need to type your password.|
    |Enter PG Database|Enter your postgres database name which you are already sharing between multiple kong nodes.|
    
- Done. If you get any problem please check the `gg-kong-setup-error.log` and `gg-kong-setup.log` log files.

For more kong configurations, you need to update the `/etc/kong/kong.conf`.
